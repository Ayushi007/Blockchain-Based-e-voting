# Blockchain-Based-e-voting

Blockchain is a constantly growing ledger that keeps a permanent record of all the transactions that have taken place, in a secure, chronological and immutable way that makes peer to peer value transfer possible. 
E-voting was introduced with the goal of minimizing the cost of conducting an election, while fulfilling and increasing the security conditions. But EVMs (Electronic voting machines) have been viewed as flawed, by the security community, primarily based on physical security concerns.

## Motivation 
Using blockchain for implementing e-voting system makes the whole mechanism robust (due to decentralization), it ensures that the process is transparent and allows voters and candidates to check their votes anytime, and makes sure that the procedure is tamper free since the blockchain is immutable and cannot be edited anytime. 
Since we use blocchain for the purpose, the counting process is eased and manipulation free. It also maintains the privacy of the voter from the election commission in case duress occurs at a later stage. 
We propose to use private blockchain for the purpose to ensure closed elections where voters and candidates are all permissioned to vote based on their identity (for eg. govt. issued ID card number). It also ensures that the traffic is regulated on the network because no unauthorized voters are allowed to join.  

## Proposed Approach 

### Components 

1. Election Commission - It is an authority which maintains a list of ID numbers corresponding to the permissioned voters and candidates. It is involved in the first step when the voter/candidate tries to register for the voting process. It verifies their authority and send them a reference number for future voting procedure. 

2. Trusted Third Party - This is involved in the voting procedure to mask the identity of the voter from the Election Commission. It ensures that the voter is registered by communicating with the EC and allows the voter to proceed to the voting page where he/she can view the eligible candidates. 

3. Participant - A Participant is anyone with a valid ID who can either vote or can contest elections. The participants can be of two types: Voter & Candidate. For registering the participant needs to contact the election commisision and get a reference number to be authorized to vote.
